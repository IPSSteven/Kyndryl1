#### Running the ID Upload Utility
 ## need to be logged in via sudo to ereg at the top of page.
 ./uploadutility.sh -S S -O -f uploadProject/FileName.txt &
 ./uploadutility.sh -S S -s ABC123 -t ncodb/nco2db (Tag option)
	## Can change the properties file to run for single user then change back prior to -t tag change. 
 ## replace FileName.txt with the name of the file you wish to use for upload.
 ## The & at the end will force code to execute in the background

#### Monitoring log file for ID Upload Utility

 tail LogFileName.log
  ## will show last 10 lines
 tail -f LogFileName.log
  ## will show last 10 lines of log file then keep refreshing for new data.

#### Strings to look for
- Unable to extract ID file for $sn 
- Uploaded shortname: $sn | grep successfully
- ID file already in vault for: $sn

#### Chron Tab to see what jobs running on server.
-  sudo to root ## sudo root
-  crontab -l

### Checking Ocean ID Vault for Shortname
-  db2 "select rundate,serialnumber,idfile,status from rawdatalotusnotes  where shortname = '<Shortname> and domain = 'Ocean'"


01.13.22 - PWD for OCNUPLD1 Changed to ProjectAustin1@#

### To stop a server instance - Example PWReset1(-4) (IBM) or OCPWreset1/2 (Ocean)
- from /home/pwreset1/pwreset structure
- Check logs first to make sure server is not in middle of processing
- ./stop-server.sh (this .sh file should be in place)
- ./start-server.sh (this .sh file should be in place)

### To enable short cuts and intelligent word/phrase sensing (auto complete)
- set -o vi
- ## Need to figure out what key or key combination I should be using after this.
